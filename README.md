# TicTacToe

Simple Tic Tac Toe game made in C++. To start a game, type START, or to quit the program, type QUIT. Then the program will randomly pick who is x's and who is o's. X goes first. To place a piece, use the key words 'top left', 'top middle', 'top right', 'middle left', 'center', 'middle right', 'bottom left', 'bottom middle', and 'bottom right'. All of these key words are case sensitive. 

Once you place a piece, the computer will automatically make its move. The computer AI just chooses a random open space. When you win, the program takes you back to the menu where you can select to start a new game or quit.

I only made this maybe 2 months ago as of 2/21/2021, but looking back at it, I already see many ways that I could improve it, both functionality wise and code wise.
